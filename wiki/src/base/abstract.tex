Currently there exists multiple stress tools and benchmarks for testing Web hosting systems. One major downside is their lack of control over the testing process, along with unrealistic user simulation. To overcome these problems, we designed and implemented WordPressBench, which is a WordPress-based benchmark whose purpose is to test various Web hosting systems. It generates fluctuating traffic intensity through a variable number of emulated users. The distributed design of WordPressBench makes possible to support a large amount of traffic, with no bottlenecks. By using WordPress, a blogging and website platform running on millions web servers, WordPressBench adds more realism to the simulation.
