Currently there are multiple stress tools and benchmarks available for testing Web hosting systems. One major downside is their lack of control over the testing process, along with unrealistic user simulation. However, in order to overcome these problems, we designed and implemented WordPressBench, which is a WordPress-based benchmark designed to test various Web hosting systems. It aims at bringing flexible user controls and realistic Web traffic simulation. It generates fluctuating traffic intensity through a variable number of emulated users. The distributed design makes possible to support a large amount of traffic, with no bottlenecks. By using WordPress, a blogging and website platform running on millions web servers, WordPressBench adds more realism to the simulation.
