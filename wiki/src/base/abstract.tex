When it comes to the stress tools or benchmarks currently available for testing hosting systems, there are only a few options to choose from. We designed and implemented WordPressBench, which is a WordPress-based benchmark which aims at bringing a realistic Web  traffic simulation. The distributed design makes possible to support a large amount of traffic, with no bottlenecks. The benchmark provides more control over the testing process, by generating fluctuating traffic intensity through a variable number of emulated users. By using WordPress, a blogging and website platform running on millions web servers, WordPressBench adds more realism to the simulation.
