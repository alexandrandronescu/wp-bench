Current IT trends are moving towards fully developed Internet applications and storage services. Lightweight Internet services like e-mail, social networking and news and blog feeds are also very popular and are used daily by most Internet users. The information demand is getting very high, so the information availability is important, as well as a high level of reliability. For offering Internet applications and storage services there is an obvious need of a strong infrastructure support which needs extensive testing beforehand. Academic researchers and industry developers need benchmarks to test their databases, load balancers, application servers, cloud computing platforms, or other Web hosting platforms. They not only need massive load generators, but also realistic web traffic, which emulates users as precise as possible. This is done by analyzing and modeling their behavior. The benchmarks offer an idea of how the resource provisioning system would react in extreme cases like overload, or flash crowds. Besides this, the benchmarks offer a reproducible and comparable simulation needed for comparing different systems, or even the same updated system.

Benchmarks generate web traffic simulations for stressing various components of the hosting system under test. The Web Server is the main component of the resource provisioning system, being the contact point where all requests are sent. This is why the Web Server is the most tested component. Most systems also include a Database Server, which is tested through intensive read/write requests of either static or dynamic data.  Some sysytems might also contain a Cache Server, Image Server, or a Multimedia Server, depending on what is their purpose, which also needs to be put under test.

In the last years, as soon as the demand for such benchmarks increased, a few benchmarks have emerged and are still used up to this moment. Some of them are very popular, like TPC-W[], which is viewed as an industry standard for testing hosting systems, despite the fact that is declared outdated. Although it was originally build for testing hardware by generating massive load, nowadays its modified versions are used in academia for testing resource provisioning systems.  TPC-W simulates a retail book-store website and emulates thousands of browsers. Similarly, RUBBoS[] and RUBBiS[] model a bulletin board website, and an e-commerce website. The applications are centered on simulating a massive number of HTTP requests.

The main problems with the previous benchmarks is that they do not consider the best design choices, and do not offer very realistic simulations of web traffic. They offer little control over the simulation, having pre-defined scales. These are very useful when trying to compare other systems, or when trying to repeat the simulation, but do not offer flexibility. The websites which are using are custom made for this purpose, and therefore are not very convincing. 

WikiBench[] is an academic  benchmark, made for testing server platforms, and which uses real traffic by manipulating real Wikipedia traffic database dumps. It offers a high degree of realism and its results are reproducible. Despite the fixed traffic traces, the traffic characteristics can be modified for the simulation, lowering the realism of the simulation. Users can change the read/write ratio, or modify the traffic intensity.

WordPressBench was created in order to surpass some of the problems of current benchmarks. WordPressBench is a Web-hosting benchmark for testing various Web-server platforms by emulating real-user behavior. Its web-servers run WordPress, a real website, used by a large number of Internet users. The benchmark's main advantage is that it offers a distributed configuration of the system, following a master-slave architecture, which is closer to a real environment. The users are emulated better, being placed on multiple servers, and there is no constant number of users. Also, WordPressBench provides a more flexible interface offering control over the simulation. The benchmark does not use traffic dumps and generates all the traffic on the fly, so no additional databases or storage is needed.

The remainder of the document is organizes as follows. Section 2 describes the existent benchmarks and their issues and in Section 3 is offered an overview of WordPressBench with the challenges we met, scope and requirements. Section 4 offers a more detailed description of each component of  WordPressBench. Section 5 describes the evaluation process of the system.
Section 6 offers a few ideas for future extensions after whicg the conclusion drawn.
